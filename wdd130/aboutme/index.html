        <h2>Hi my name is Aaron Santos</h2>
        <h2>"Ron"</h2>
        <p>As someone born in the year 2000, it becomes quite easy to guess that I am already 22 years old. <br>
        I live in the southern island in the Philippines and served my mission in Luzon. I work as an intern <br>
        web developer here at a local business (I am still not very good at this but I am trying). <br>
        Ever since I was 14 years old, I became interested with the internet and more particularly with websites.<br> 
        2014 was the year we had a family reunion and then I wanted to make a blogsite to post our photos (perhaps <br>
        it was my way of preserving our precious memories)--This then became the beginning of my desire to pursue <br>
        this career.</p>

        <p>I have been a member of the church ever since I was 8 years old. I have always enjoyed staying,  <br>
        serving and learing here. My belief in Jesus Christ gave me so much peace despite having all the <br>
        problems around me. Because of that I can foucs on the more beautiful things. I am not married, <br>
        however, I desire to be married eventually &#128516; </p>

        <p>Apparently, I never thought I would be enrolling to <em>BYU Pathway Worldwide</em>. I was surprised at my decision <br>
        as well. But ever since <em>Pathway Connect,</em> I started loving the feeling of being with church members at <br>
        school--I felt like I really belong here. I wanted to pursue this course (along the reason I stated above) <br>
        because I know that technology will continue to be part of our daily lives. With this, I know that this profession <br>
        or this knowledge that I have won't go obsolete anytime soon. </p>
