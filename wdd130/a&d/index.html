                <p>Hi my name is Aaron Santos. I live in the Philippines and here is where I started to learn how to code. <br>
                I first introduced how to write HTML when I was still 12 years old however, I did not understand it. <br>
                After coming home from my mission in Quezon City, I was able to revisit this when I was offered to have a job <br>
                in IhelpCreate--a company my sister started few years while I was in my mission. I realised how much I love writing code<br>
                when I started my first project and then here I am now.</p>
