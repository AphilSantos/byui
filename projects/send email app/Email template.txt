<p>Hey there Aaron,</p>

<p>I hope this message finds you well. As your Peer Mentor at BYU-Pathway Worldwide, I'm here to support you on your educational journey. I'm also a fellow Online Degree student pursuing Software Development while residing in The Philippines.</p>

<p>I wanted to inform you about the Heber J. Grant Tuition Discount scholarship opportunity. To benefit from this, complete the interactive questionnaire located in your student portal before 11:59pm on September 7 MST. This discount ranges from 10% to 50% and is a great way to reduce your tuition fees.</p>

</p>I'm excited to work with you this term. I'll be in touch regularly to help you prepare for the upcoming term. Please share your preferred contact method. I recommend WhatsApp or Facebook for quicker responses. WhatsApp is free to download. I am happy to assist if needed.</p>
