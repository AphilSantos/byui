    <p>

Right now, I really want to bring you flowers pero I know I cannot do that karon so I decided to do this instead. I hope you like it and I hope na pamaagi ani, makadunggag ug hatag sa imoa ug assurance na ako ug ang Ginoo nihigugma nimo kaayo. Tuyo pud nako mapakita sa imoa akong growth while I am here waiting for you. Love, I never knew na possible diay ni nga mahack nako ang gmail interface para maka design (hack--in a good way hehe). I think I really learned this for a reason and ang purpose is to help me sa atoang relationship bisan layo kaayo kitang duha sa matag-usa. Sagol-sagol ang akong message love so pasensya kung nahalo ang seryoso ug kacorny hahaha!
<br>I hope you will enjoy this and I hope makahatag ni ug clarity because of the email na akong gisulat sa Monday. <br><br>

First of all love, you are amazing! You have been very considerate sa akoa, sa akong feelings, ug mabati nako imong sincerity ug gugma sa akoa. If you think nagkulang ka, please stop thinking about that because ako na mismo nag ingon na "You are enough." This time gusto ko mubawi ug ikaw nasad akong tagaan ug tabang. I know lisud and very confusing ni nga time para nimo nga pauliay naka. Ang pressure nga dapat maka andam ka sa imong next steps makadungag sa imong mga burdens. I don't fully understand imong struggles pero I know nga dili sya sayun. You keep doing your best and I am very proud of you. Seryoso ko love na proud ko sa imoa. 
<br><br>
After reading your email sa monday for the first time, to be honest na shock ko... Pero when I read it again sa Tuesday after ko naminaw sa mga messages sa last na General Conference and sa among Family Home evening (late mi nag family home evening hahaha) narealise nako imong true intention. Nakita nako imong kasing-kasing and imbes na mashock ko kai nalipay kaayo ko. Love, you are a promise-keeper. You are strong-willed and honest. I understand you are worried ---pero please relax. I also understand na ga struggle ka makadawat ug answers sa Ginoo especially about marriage pero I think you should continue to be patient. I promise you nga naa ko diri para maghulat nimo. Love, pwede ko mahimong bold sa imoa kadyut ... Because naa naka'y uyab (ako hehehe --proud ko gamay-- haha) marriage is not a decision for you to make alone anymore (Kung single paka then, you can decide anything at anytime). Which is maybe why dili paka makadawat ug revelations/answers now. Pero that doesn't mean na dili ka maka prepare magreceive ug revelation. Mao ni akong suggestion love, before ka muadto sa imong My Plan Convention before ka maka-uli, ask your question sa imong Mission President about marriage. If pwede ug kung kaya nimo, tell him about me. Love, importante ka sa imong Mission President and I know iyaang advice makatabang sa imoa. In the mission, he is your patriarch. 
<br><br>
Love, now that na ingon na nako sa imoa imong gipangayo na advice. I want to continue now sa akong clarifications and right now I will tell you my plan:
<br><br>
I love you very very much love and I want you to be happy. I also want to be your happiness which is why maningkamot ko na pilion ko nimo makauban permi... There is a reason why I ga work ko ug grabi karon. Other than just saving for the future, gusto pud ko maanad nga mahimong busy and responsible because I know that if I really want to spend my life with you, dili ko pwede mag basta-basta lang ug relax. Dili pud ko mubiya sa akong school because dili ko pwede ma-zero in the future. Need pud nako ang help ni Heavenly Father which is gasugot ko ug mga callings.
<br><br>
<ol>
These are my goals dear:
<li>I want to be married to you and ang mga musunod are the benefits why I think this should be first:</li>
<li> Dili nako gusto mulayo sa imoa ug dili nako gusto na mulayo ka sa akoa. I want to be in the same places with you na. I want to be your official partner. I need us to be our help-meet.</li>
<li> I want to help you sa imong pag skwela as one of my responsibilities as your partner. I want to go to BYU-Hawaii with you too pero para mutaas akong chance maka i-work dadto dapat makita sa BYU na "provider" ko para less ang chance na magbayad sila ate gra or sister grace sa akoang education. 
Ang akong ginabuhat karon para mutaas akong chances makasulod (bisan dili i-work) kai mag kuha ug certifications.</li>
<li> I want to start early business with you. For the meantime, ikeep sa nako akong work for security pero kung gusto gyud ko mulambo, business is the way to go. We can start small like mamaligya pero ganahan ko na mudako para makahatag ta ug trabaho sa lain tao.</li>
<li> I want to help our families. Kabalo ko sa gusto sa imong family especially para kai brother Dante. Wala ko nila gipugos pero I want to make that dream come true pud. Naa skills imong papa love na nindot tagaan ug puhunan which is why I am thinking na nindot ni himoun ug part sa atoang business, if not the first business na atong buhaton. (Never ko nag mention ani with others because I need your help ani if willing ka). Naa pud mi plans sa akong family para sa akong parents and so far consistent among communications.</li>
<li> I want to be a blessing to the church and working as a couple and a family is very nice.</li>
</ol>
Dear, kani nga mga plans kai dagko kaayo. I know dili pud ni masunod tanan or maybe isa or duha lang ang masunod ani. I know you are worried and maybe naa ka fear about sa kalisud sa married na life especially pag naa na anak. I understand that love, which is why never ka nako pugson. Pero for me, if I do well sa akong paghulat sa imoa and after sa atoang paningkamot, then the Lord's grace will be sufficient kung unsa man na.
Again dear, I know dagko kaayo ni nga mga goals and I cannot do all of these alone. If you also want these things dear, I want us to do these together. Would you be better to do this alone, or do you think you have a better chance of succeeding kung naa kai 4 hands instead of 2, 2 brains and hearts instead of 1? Kani nga question kai para sa atoang duha.
<br><br>
Love, I know I said na "I cannot wait for you forever." Please don't misunderstand this.  It doesn't mean dili nako maghulat sa imoa. Sa tanan futures akong makita na malipayun ko, it would be the future with you. What I mean by saying "I cannot wait" is if mupili ka na mag-inusara sa for a long time. If you carry on a journey without me "physically with you."
<br><br>
Love, if you still have fears, I want to strengthen you with the words of our Savior.
<div style="font-style: italic; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">

<p>"...I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world... ." -- Matthew 28:20

    <br><br>

"...Cheerfully do all things that lie in your power; ... may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed." -- Doctrine and Covenants 123:17
<br><br>
"...Be not afraid, only believe." Mark 5:36</p>
</div>
The Lord of all, loves you so much. Ang purpose sa imong mission is to help you meet ang challenges in the future. You are not alone dear and I am willing to be with you. I have a few quotes from leaders of the church love na ganahan nako ishare sa imoa about the Atonement of Jesus Christ:
<div style="font-style: italic; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<p>"In a moment of weakness we may cry out, “No one knows what it is like. No one understands.” But the Son of God perfectly knows and understands, for He has felt and borne our individual burdens. And because of His infinite and eternal sacrifice (see Alma 34:14), He has perfect empathy and can extend to us His arm of mercy. He can reach out, touch, succor, heal, and strengthen us to be more than we could ever be and help us to do that which we could never do relying only upon our own power." -- Elder Bednar, "Bear Up Their Burdens with Ease,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2014,</p>
</div>
<p>Love, you are perfectly enough. You don't need to be perfect. Marriage is not about being perfect nor is it being 100% ready. It is only 50% of you and 50% of me. If we are sealed by the Priesthood of the Lord, then we are 100% together.</p>
<div style="font-style: italic; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; padding-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<p>"Of course, all of us will fall short of our divine potential, and there is some truth in the realization that alone we are not enough. But the good news of the gospel is that with the grace of God, we are enough. …

The surprising truth is that our weaknesses can be a blessing when they humble us and turn us to Christ. …

In fact, Jesus’s miracles often begin with a recognition of want, need, failure, or inadequacy." --Michelle D. Craig "Divine Discontent,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2018.</p>
</div>
<p>Love, know that you are strong and that you are loved. Know that you are cared for and being prayed for. Know that you are strong and smart. Know that you have a testimony sa mga promises sa Ginoo if you align your will with His.
<br><br>
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH LOVE! I am sorry for misunderstanding imong email last time. I think I needed a little bit of help adto nga panahon. Please know na I am getting a little better every day since last week.
<br><br>
Take care always dear and please forgive my weaknesses. I hope naka tabang ko nimo ug ang akong email give peace sa imong heart. If you continue to be worried and maglisud kaayo ka even after sa akong email, please ask a blessing from your Mission President.
<br><br>
I LOVE YOU ALL THE WAY LOVE!
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Aaron Phil

            Going to school takes a lot of diligence, hard work, and sacrifice. Many students who started out with enthusiasm may begin to lose focus and become discouraged at this time.
        </div>
        
        <div style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            I am confident that you have had many life experiences which led you to BYU-Pathway Worldwide. No matter how you were led here at this time, you made the decision to step on this path, and stepping forward has led you to where you are now. Keep going! Keep trusting. Keep believing. The Lord is aware of you and your situation. He believes in you.

On a scale of 1-10, where 10 is very high and 1 is very low, how would you rate your current level of motivation?
