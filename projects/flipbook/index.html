            <h2>A Jester’s Tale</h2>
            <p>By Riley Gilmore</p>
            <p>Jinx sat huddled in a dark corner of a cold, dank dungeon, imprisoned in the most feared 
            bowels of Malmoral Castle for what now seemed like eons. Her black clothes, caked in 
            sweat and dirt, hung loosely on her frail body. Her long, raven black hair fell in greasy 
            strands along the length of her back and cascaded over her face, blessedly obscuring the 
            dismal view of her surroundings. Her mesmerizing gray eyes now glistened with ever-present tears, where once upon a time they sparkled with joy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page front-right">
            <p>She had no real sense of time 
            anymore, but somehow instinctively knew that the sun would be up soon and would cast 
            shards of light through the cracks in the wall near the ceiling. She lived to see that small 
            glimpse of the outside world, cursing cloudy days that denied her that one small pleasure. 
            Sadly, the arrival of the dawn also brought with it the certainty that he would soon appear, 
            as he had done every morning since her capture.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page back-left">
            <p>Her reverie was abruptly interrupted by the sound of heavy footsteps coming closer and 
            closer. Her captor, Captain of the Guard Jean LaSalle, was approaching as expected. He 
            knocked three times on the massive wooden dungeon door, not out of any kind of courtesy 
            or respect for Jinx, but as a way of frightening the various rats with which she shared her 
            living quarters into scattering away in a frenzy. The door slowly opened on squeaky hinges, 
            LaSalle no longer even bothering to lock it after himself upon leaving her each day as Jinx 
            hadn’t had the energy to stand, let alone attempt an escape, for some months now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page back-right">
            <p>Eager eyes held wide, Jinx slowly raised her face to meet the meager rays of sunshine as 
            they fought to enlighten her cell, basking her in images of days long gone when she was 
            free, loved, and happy. She taunted herself with memories of delicious meals shared with 
            family, lively jousting tournaments, the handsome smile of the man she loved, and the 
            cherished friends she would die to protect…</p>
