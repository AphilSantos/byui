        <div class="page" id="page1">A Jester’s Tale<br>By Riley Gilmor<p>Jinx sat huddled in a dark corner of a cold, dank dungeon, imprisoned in the most feared 
            bowels of Malmoral Castle for what now seemed like eons. Her black clothes, caked in 
            sweat and dirt, hung loosely on her frail body. Her long, raven black hair fell in greasy 
            strands along the length of her back and cascaded over her face, blessedly obscuring the 
            dismal view of her surroundings. Her mesmerizing gray eyes now glistened with everpresent tears, where once upon a time they sparkled with joy. She had no real sense of time

            Eager eyes held wide, Jinx slowly raised her face to meet the meager rays of sunshine as 
they fought to enlighten her cell, basking her in images of days long gone when she was 
free, loved, and happy. She taunted herself with memories of delicious meals shared with 
family, lively jousting tournaments, the handsome smile of the man she loved, and the 
cherished friends she would die to protect…
